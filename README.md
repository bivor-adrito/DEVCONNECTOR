# DevConnector
A MERN Stack project to connect developers.<br>
Description of the project: It is a MERN stack project to connect developers. It uses Node.js express framework in the backend and connects with MongoDB Atlas as the database. Moreover, in the front-end, I have used React.js. It uses basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the profiles and posts. I have also used JWT authentication using the SHA256 algorithm. To check the API I have used Postman.
